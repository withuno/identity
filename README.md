# identity
The Uno identity platform.

There are two binaries, `uno` and `api`.

* `uno` is the cli for interacting with libuno and with the api.
* `api` is the server hosting vault and shmirs split/combine endpoints.

Supporting crates include: `adi`, `djb`, and `lib`.

* `adi` contains our reference implementation of SSS, guided by HashiCorp's go implementation.
* `djb` contains Curve25519 crypto, both symmetric cand asymmetric (chacha20-poly1305 AEAD and ed25519 public key signing).
* `lib` is libuno, which incorporates `adi` and `djb` as well as providing types for creating and working with uno identities (32 bytes of entropy plus some kdf).

TODO: link the subdirs.

# Usage

Run the uno cli like:
```
cargo run --bin uno
```

Same goes for the server:
```
cargo run --bin api
```

You can test everything using:
```
cargo test
```

If you just want to run the tests in a single "package", use:
```
cargo test -p <pkg>
```

For example, `cargo test -p adi` or `cargo test -p uno`.
