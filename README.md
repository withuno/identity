Uno Identity Manager
===

The [Uno][uno] identity platform is a modern <strike>password</strike> identity manager.
We have full featured clients on iOS/macOS ([join the waitlist][waitlist]) with an accompanying [browser extension][chrome-ext] for Safari and the Chrome family of browsers.
This is our Rust reference implementation with a CLI and associated API server.
You can read more about our project and design on [our blog][blog].

Note: the CLI is not currently designed to be used as a fully functional Uno client in the way our mobile, desktop, and browser applications are.
If you're intersted in a full-featured open source rust CLI password manager like we are, please, help us build it out (:

# Overview

There are two binaries:

* [`uno`](cli) is the cli for interacting with libuno and with the API.
* [`api`](api) is the server used for storage, messaging, email verification, phone directory, and ephemeral sessions.

Supporting crates include:

* [`adi`](adi) contains our reference implementation of [SSS][sss], guided by HashiCorp's [go implementation][hashi-sss].
* [`djb`](djb) contains Curve25519 crypto, both symmetric cand asymmetric (chacha20-poly1305 AEAD and ed25519 public key signing).
* [`ffi`](ffi) contains the C bindings for libuno.
* [`lib`](lib) is libuno, which incorporates `s39` and `djb` as well as providing types for creating and working with uno identities (32 bytes of entropy plus some kdf).
* [`s39`](s39) exposes  SLIP-39 functionality using Uno library types.
* [`wsm`](wsm) [wasm][wasm] [bindings][wbindgen] for libuno, used in our browser extensions.
* [`xcf`](xcf) packages the `ffi` as an XCFramework use with [UnoSwift][] in our iOS and macOS apps.

# Usage

Run the uno CLI like:
```
cargo run --bin uno
```

Or the API server:
```
cargo run --bin api
```

Test everything using:
```
cargo test
```

If you just want to run the tests in a single "package", use:
```
cargo test -p <pkg>
```

For example, `cargo test -p lib` or `cargo test -p uno`.

If something feels slow, remember by default you're running a debug configuration.
Try the `--release` flag, the hash functions run noticably faster with optimizations.

# Style

Code should read like a book.
The style goal in this repo is to structure code such that it grows vertically instead of horizontally.
Prefer pulling expressions into local variables over deeply nested matching.
Lines that are consistently the same length and shape are easier to reason about.
To that end, we have an arbitrary column limit of 80 chars.
If your lines are under the limit, you're probably doing it right.
Everything else is handled by the Rust formatter.
```
cargo +nightly fmt
```
We use format options only available in nightly, so be sure to run with `+nightly`.

The README is sentence lines.
Since we're writing prose that gets formatted by whatever is rendering it, we don't care about manually formatting the README.
It's easier to move sentences around when they're on individual lines, so that's what we do.


# Legal things

Inspired by Signal's README (but not copied verbatim because we are EAR99):

## Cryptography Notice

This distribution includes cryptographic software.
The country in which you currently reside may have restrictions on the import, possession, use, and/or re-export to another country, of encryption software.
BEFORE using any encryption software, please check your country's laws, regulations and policies concerning the import, possession, or use, and re-export of encryption software, to see if this is permitted.
See <http://www.wassenaar.org/> for more information.

In it's current form, this software exists to help users practically and securely manage their account credentials and login information.
In the United States, under the Export Administration Regulations (“EAR”), encryption software limited to authentication applications is not controlled as an encryption item and can be classified under Export Commodity Control Number (ECCN): **EAR99**.
The usage of encryption in this software is limited to the support of its primary function: password management and authentication.
Thus, this software does not require specific U.S. government authorization to export in either object or source form.
